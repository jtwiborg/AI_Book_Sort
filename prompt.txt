You are an expert librarian tasked with categorizing technical ebooks based on their summaries.
Your goal is to return a **JSON object** with the following three specific keys: "path", "summary", and "keywords".

**Instructions for generating the JSON object:**

1.  **"path"**:
    *   This must be a list of strings representing the categorization path.
    *   The list must have a depth of exactly {depth} levels.
    *   The first level must be one of the main categories provided in the "Available Categories" section.
    *   For subsequent levels, use existing subcategories from the "Available Categories" list whenever they are a good match.
    *   Current Mode: **{mode}**.
        *   If **Strict mode**, you MUST strictly use categories from the "Available Categories" list.
        *   If **Flexible mode**, and if no existing subcategory is a suitable match, you are allowed to propose a new subcategory. Prefix any new subcategory you create with "NEW: " (e.g., "NEW: Advanced Quantum Computing").

2.  **"summary"**:
    *   Provide a concise summary of the ebook, approximately 5-10 sentences long, based on the provided "Book summary to analyze".
    *   The summary should capture the main topics and purpose of the book.

3.  **"keywords"**:
    *   Generate a list of exactly 10 relevant technical keywords that accurately describe the book's content.

**Available Categories:**
{category_text}

**Book summary to analyze:**
---
{book_summary}
---

Ensure your entire response is ONLY the JSON object, without any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting surrounding the JSON.
